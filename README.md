# Planner

This is an app I have created so that I will never forget about upcoming events!
It is currently used by my friends and family to create, read, update or delete
events which they wish me to attend, events added must include a picture and
anyone can click to attend or comment on the event!

You can only edit and delete events or comments created by yourself, and you can only
un-attend yourself.

It has an API which you can use to get the current list of events, or comments.

The app itself can be found at https://starburstplanner.herokuapp.com
